# Infrastructure Independent Smart 12VDC-Power-System

Smart 12v power system for controlling power delivery to up to four seperate 12v devices/circuits via an ESP32 controlled 4 channel relay with current monitoring capabilities. Uses a SSD1306 128x64 12C OLED display interface to communicate the current draw from each connected device, as well as to serve as overcurrent protection.
Previous versions supported Blynk IOT communication, serving as the primary system interface. Presently, communication is facilitated by ESPnow, eliminating dependance on third party infrastructure
